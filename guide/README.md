# Guide

Welcome to the VuePress starter template for [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io). To learn more about VuePress in general and how to customize this project, please see the [VuePress documentation](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org).

## Theme Customization

This template uses the default VuePress theme. To learn more about what you can do with it, please see the [Default Theme Config](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html#homepage) guide.

If you want to customize the default VuePress theme, you can do this in a few ways, but to various extents.

### Color Overrides

If you would like to keep the default theme and only change the colors, you can change a few variables by creating a `palette.style` file in a `styles` directory under `.vuepress`. Here you have the option to pick a new accent, text, border and code block background color.

```stylus
// showing default values
$accentColor = #3eaf7c
$textColor = #2c3e50
$borderColor = #eaecef
$codeBgColor = #282c34
```

### Style Overrides

You can also add your own styles or override general styles by creating a `index.styl` file in the same `/styles` directory as the `palette.styl` file mentioned above. This is a Stylus file, but you can write normal CSS syntax as well.

```css
.sidebar {
  background: pink;
}
```

### Custom Page Classes

VuePress also lets you specify custom classes for your pages in YAML front matter. This can be useful when you want to target specific content on a page. Use `pageClass` to add a class to the theme container div tag:

```yaml
---
pageClass: custom-page-class
---
```

Then you can write CSS to target that specific page in `.vuepress/styles/index.styl`:

```css
.theme-container.custom-page-class .language-example {
  border: 4px solid #3eaf7c;
}
```

As an example, we have added a `pageClass` of `custom-page-class` to this page and targeted this code block that has a language of `example` with the styles from above:

```example
A code block with a custom language targeted with a custom page class.
```

### Ejecting

If you would like to customize the default theme even more and have full control over how the different components look like, you can eject the default theme.

::: warning
When ejecting you are on your own and **will not** be receiving future updates or bug fixes to the default theme even if you upgrade your VuePress version.
:::

To get started, copy the default theme source code into `.vuepress/theme` using the `vuepress eject [targetDir]` command.

## Custom Themes

When you want to create a custom VuePress theme, you add a `theme` directory under `.vuepress` (`.vuepress/theme`) and start by adding a `Layout.vue` file. From there it's the same as developing a normal Vue application. It is entirely up to you how you organize your theme.

The content of your `markdown` files to be rendered will be available as a special global component called `<Content/>`. You will need to add this somewhere in your layout in order to render and display the content of the page/markdown file. 

The simplest theme can be a single `Layout.vue` component with the following content:

```html
<template>
  <div class="theme-container">
    <Content/>
  </div>
</template>
```

For more information about how to get started with custom VuePress themes, please refer to the [Writing a theme](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/writing-a-theme.html) guide. If you would like to see how others have created custom themes, see the [VuePress Gallery](https://vuepress.gallery).
